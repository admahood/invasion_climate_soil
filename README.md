This is the repository that houses the data and code to reproduce the analysis of our paper in Global Change Biology: "Interannual climate variability mediates changes in carbon and nitrogen pools caused by annual grass invasion in a semi-arid shrubland"

The script to create figures 1 and 2 is `R/c_js_figs.R`, the script for figures 3 and 4 is `R/tidymods.R`.

`R/ggplot_sem.R` contains functions to create figures from lavaan objects, and these are used to create figure 5 in `R/d_sem_mods.R`. An older version of the manuscript had path models for plant C:N ratios as well, and the code for those is still in `R/d_sem_mods.R`.

Things might be a little less than straightforward, but the data are all there. Feel free to reach out with any questions!
